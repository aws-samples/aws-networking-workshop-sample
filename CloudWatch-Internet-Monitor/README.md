# Internet Monitor OpenSearch Dashboard
CloudWatch Internet Monitor publishes the performance score, availability score, monitored bytes transferred (bytes in and bytes out), and round-trip time for the city-networks (locations and ASNs) specific to your application to CloudWatch Logs for the top 500 city-networks. CloudWatch Internet Monitor now includes the ability to publish internet measurements to Amazon S3 for all the monitored city-networks.

After ingest the measurements data to Amazon OpenSearch, you can visulize and get insight from AWS Internet Monitor measurements via OpenSearch Dashboard easily. This sample Dashboard is created by AWS GCR Enterprise Support Team.
